                    <div class="card-body"> Couchbase is capable enough of storing key-values as well as credentials. Thus, it can store data like binary data, JSON documents, and many more.Couchbase server makes use of a binary Memcached protocol to perform the high-end functionalities as well as REST APIâs SQL in order to view the queries.
Apache CouchDB, on the contrary, is capable of storing JSON documents. It also provides facilities to attach non-JSON files to the JSON documents.

                    <div class="card-body"> First and foremost, Couchbase server happens to be a super-fast and highly scalable key-value store which is known for its high-end scalability as well as performance. Secondly, CouchDB, on the contrary, is an excellent document database that comes with powerful querying as well as indexing capabilities. So combining the aforementioned two would be beneficial. Not only will it create a high-end performance, but also highly elastic NoSQL database that will scale out the linearly. At the same time, it will also provide indexing, querying as well as other document-oriented features. Hence including Couchbase and CouchDB will be beneficial. </div>
