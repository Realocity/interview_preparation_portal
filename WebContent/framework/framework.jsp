<br>Angular is a modular and scalable framework that, given that it's based on web components standard, allows you to encapsulate individual custom HTML elements you can later reuse at your will. Additionally, Angular is open source, which means you'll have enough flexibility to tackle your projects with it, and a huge community with many available resources you can turn for help.
