<br>Angular is a modular and scalable framework that, given that it’s based on web components standard, allows you to encapsulate individual custom HTML elements you can later reuse at your will. Additionally, Angular is open source, which means you’ll have enough flexibility to tackle your projects with it, and a huge community with many available resources you can turn for help.

        Karate combines API test automation with mocking and performance testing into a single, unified framework. You can write tests with simple syntax and mix API and UI test automation in the same script for maximum efficiency. And if you want higher performance, you can run tests in parallel, which will be extremely helpful for HTTP API testing.
        <br>Karate is very easy to get started with, even if you haven’t programmed in your life. It includes simple and meaningful assets for large responses and can come up with data-driven tests that can use JSON or CSV sources. It’s lightning-fast, especially when testing APIs, but it provides great performance in all of its tests.
